    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset represents the extent and approximate location of [Geographically Isolated Wetlands](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/geographically-isolated-wetlands-non-floodplain-wetlands-of-the-conterminous-united-states1) (GIWs), also known as non-floodplain wetlands (NFWs), in the conterminous United States. National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) lacustrine systems and palustrine wetlands were determined to be “isolated” based on their geographic location (i.e., unconnected, based on a distance measure, to specific classes of NHD aquatic systems). GIWs were here considered geographically isolated when they were outside of 10 meters from select NHD lines and polygons or were not adjacent to NWI Riverine or Estuarine wetlands and (where applicable) outside of 10 meters from a coastline (e.g., oceans or Great Lakes).\n",
